Dark Seed 2: 2

This is a spiritual sequel to the game Dark Seed 2.

It follows in the footsteps of Mark Dawson, the brother of Dark Seed 2's hero Mike Dawson.

The creative aspects of the game are still in the making and are currently being fleshed out in a google doc.

The technical aspects of the game's implementation have been... fluid.  
Following is a short description of where the code is at the moment as of 02/18/2012

This game is using the gosu game library
main.rb is the main entry point of the code.  The basic game loop is in the update and draw methods
It's supposed to hold only code that relates to drawing and dealing with talking to gosu and such
All business logic is ideally to be delegated to...
game.rb is where a large portion of the game's logic resides.  It handles keeping track of 
the game objects, areas, and the relationships between all the moving parts.
game_object.rb is another big class.  It's the generic form of game_object and represents a set of
reasonable defaults.  In theory, a game_object who has not been overridden in any way should still 
be functional even if it is boring and semantically bizarre

The game's state is basically defined in 3 places.  
data/game_objects/<object_name>/logic.rb
  This is where the default behavior for a given object can be overridden
  Handy things to override are def on_click(x,y), def on_examine(), def dialogs(), etc...
  This file is for constant logical behavior.
data/state/default.yml
  This is essentially the "starting" save game.  All volatile data is saved here (object positions, locations, etc...)
  There is a "special" object defined here called "Game" which is used for game specific state
data/areas/<area_name>/data.yml
  This is a yaml file with some area configuration (currently nothing is here)
